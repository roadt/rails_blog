===  Rails Blog site

it's a blog site for my personal use , and a place to put related gems into a serious usage. 

it's ROR-based.
it's devise authentication, signup sigin.
it's cacan role based acl. 
it's omniauth github/google remote login, no need signup.
it's doorkeeper oauth provider
it's responsive.
it's not fantastic looks since not a big project but simple & clean.
